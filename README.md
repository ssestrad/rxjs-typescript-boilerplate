# RxJS TypeScript Boilerplate

Simple boilerplate for starting a project using RxJS with TypeScript and CSS Modules.

It includes a simple demo app for demonstrating the use of RxJS.
The app is a real-time wikipedia search interface.
It shows how you can leverage RxJS to process user input and network calls.

The aim of this boilerplate is to use no other framework or dependencies other than RxJS and dependencies that don't add to your JS bundle while still providing enough pieces to build a meaningful app. As such, a simple component project structure was setup with some helper classes found in the `lib` folder to simplify building the UI. The only other dependency apart from RxJS that gets included in the JS bundle is DOMPurify to prevent XSS attacks when rendering html using the `Component` class.

An ESNext version of this project is available [here](./rxjs-boilerplate). Looking at the difference between the projects can be useful for seeing how to migrate an ESNext project to TypeScript.

The project uses the [Babel TypeScript preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript) that became available with Babel 7 which makes transpiling faster while still allowing you to have type checking. It also uses ESLint instead of TSLint with the recent support for TypeScript through the [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) project.

It also uses [the typings-for-css-modules-loader](https://github.com/Jimdo/typings-for-css-modules-loader) Webpack loader to autogenerate the typings for the css module files. A `myfilename.css.d.ts` will be autogenerated next to the `myfilename.css` css module file.

## Quick Start

Make sure to have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org) 8 or greater installed.

Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/ssestrad/rxjs-typescript-boilerplate.git`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Start app

`npm start`

This will open a window with the demo at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To do type checking

`npm run type-check`

To do type checking while editing your code

`npm run type-check:watch`

By having the type checking and dev build separate, you can have two processes running at the same time, one that is building the JS that runs on the browser and one that is checking for correct typings. This way if you're playing around or debugging a feature, you can continue to test the app without worrying about being type safe until you're ready to clean up your code.

## To create a Release Build

`npm build`
